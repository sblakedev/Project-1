#### Design

* Colour Scheme
  * The two main colours used are Yellow and Orange. Yellow was chosen as it represents cheerfulness and friendliness. Orange was chosen as it represents playfulness and energy. These are the emotions that the classes hope to evoke so are ideal to reflect in the UX.
* Typography
  * The something font is the main font used throughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case the font isn't being imported to the site correctly.
* Imagery
  * The large hero imaage is designed to catch the user's attention and give an idea of what the website is about.
