## Twinkle Stars Baby and Toddler Groups ###

Twinkle Stars Baby and Toddler Groups is a site for parents and caregivers in Meath to join a baby, a toddler, or a baby and toddler group. It will be targeted towards parents or caregivers who are looking to socialise their babies and toddlers, and who would also like to meet other parents or caregivers. The site will be useful for parents and cargivers to see when they can join the classes and where the classes are located.

### Responsive Mockup

### User Experience (UX)

#### User stories

* Visitor Goals
    a. As a visitor, I want to understand the main purpose of the site.
    b. As a visitor, I want to be able to navigate easily around the site and find the information I'm looking for such as timetables and class location.
    c. As a visitor, I want to find information on the classes that are offered.
    d. As a visitor, I want to be able to easily sign-up to classes.
    e. As a visitor, I want to be able to easily get in contact with the organisation who runs the classes with any questions.

#### Design

* Colour Scheme
  * The two main colours used are Green and Pink. Yellow was chosen as it represents stimulation and comfort which are the values that the classes hope to evoke and are ideal to reflect in the UX.. Pink was chosen as it compliments Green.
* Typography
  * The Fredoka font is the main font used throughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case the font isn't being imported to the site correctly. It is clean, simple and easy to read.
* Imagery
  * The large hero image is one of a man and child playing which reflects the aim of the classes that are advertised on the website.
* Wireframes
